# Computational Finance Projects

This repository contains code, projects, and resources developed as part of the Computational Finance course at the University of Kiel. The course covers various numerical methods and models in finance, including binomial trees, Monte Carlo simulations, continuous market models, integral transforms, finite differences, and machine learning techniques. These methods are essential for understanding and implementing computational techniques in quantitative finance.
